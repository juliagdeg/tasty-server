# Welcome to Tasty Trails!
It’s 6pm. You’ve just gotten home from work, and realize you’ve planned nothing to eat for dinner. Exasperated, you go to the pantry and take stock of some sundried tomatoes, noodles, and vodka sauce. You also peek into the fridge and see some pecorino cheese and sourdough your mom made you last week. A nice pasta dinner SOUNDS good, but you have no recipe to follow. Just thinking about looking up a recipe on New York Times immerses you in war flashbacks, fighting for your life through pages and pages of blog posts, virus-ridden ads, and scrolling to the very bottom of the page to get to a number of comments about modifying a recipe to make it the best it can be. 
You wish there was a website where all the recipes you liked were readily available, readable, and where modifications suggested by other novice chefs were easy to translate. 

That’s where Tasty Trail comes in - an application that sources all the recipe information into one space, without all the ad clutter or blog ramblings (as heartfelt as they may be). Now, you have an easily accessible site where you can post a new recipe you just tried, and share it with other users. The comment feature allows line by line suggestions/modifications for people with different tools or food restrictions at the ready–no need to wear out your thumb with all that scrolling! You’ll be able to categorize and sort through available recipes, favorite them, and edit them as people suggest OR as you try out new ways to enhance your food. If you find you hate a recipe later on that you posted–delete it! Basically, this site is every aspiring (or lazy) internet chef’s dream.
